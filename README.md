# Expressiondetection
This is a project where I try to build a CNN which can read the current expression of my face

The dataset I will be training my CNN for expression detection:

To read capture the image of my web-cam I will use the package CV2
To detect my face from the real-time image I will use a face-detection network called MTNCNN:
